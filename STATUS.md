# Anima Song — status

Every former manual check of `TESTING.md` is now automated and green, or not applicable (table there, "What is
left of the manual checks"). Run-by-run history through 1.0.2 is in `git log` and the GitHub releases
(`docs/runs/README.md`); `docs/runs/` starts fresh from here.

## Publications

| Version | Content | Tag / release | Steam upload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0.0 | First release | `v1.0.0` on `0529c10` | ManifestID `6527602686281192937`, 2026-09-28 |
| 1.0.1 | Fix: `StampAhead` logs once instead of silently repeating the halo flicker if the reflected field is gone | `v1.0.1` on `bca2c3f` | ManifestID `9109123286002546468` |
| 1.0.2 | Description: Phytokin origin paragraph reframed in the owner's own words | `v1.0.2` on `84d7fa8` | ManifestID `4870569081021350798` |
| — | Description, hand-edited on Steam 2026-09-29: Workshop links added, no AI tool credited in Thanks | no version, no tag/release — a description-only change is not a minor bump | edited directly on the page |

**The item is public since 2026-09-29**, description edited directly on the Steam page by the owner. Rollback
target if a published revision turns out red: switch the item back to private (owner, 2026-09-25; no earlier good
version exists to republish instead).

## Publish mechanics

`Rimworld-Release-Admin/scripts/dispatch-publish.sh vbardales/Rimworld-Anima-Song publish-tag.yml <SHA> <version>
[--description]`; only Virginie approves `steam-production`. A description-only change is edited directly on the
Steam page instead: no minor version for wording. A `Mod/` change that touches code still needs a fresh dry-run of
the exact commit before a publish is dispatched. The CI creates the tag and GitHub release after a successful
upload; visibility and the gallery stay manual, the owner's.

## Still open

The French review by Virginie (see Translation audit); the regression pass otherwise stands: `9e8d` English,
`d20b` French, `a0ab` Phytokin, all green, 26–27/34 passed each, 0 failed; the 7–8 skips per run are Phytokin/
sound/studio/removal scenarios needing their own staged pass, not this one, and not a regression.

## Translation audit

French lives in two files: `Mod/Languages/French/Keyed/AnimaSong.xml` (gizmo, right-click order, its disabled
reasons, inspect lines) and `Mod/Languages/French/DefInjected/ThoughtDef/AnimaSong.xml` (the listening memory's
label and description). No grammar/Rules files.

**2026-09-30, session pass (TRANSLATIONS.md section 3, French gender agreement):** every French text read for a
past participle or adjective agreeing with the pawn. One defect found: the memory description used "je me suis
assis", masculine only, with no switch. Reworded to "j'ai pris le temps de l'écouter" — no agreement needed,
reads naturally, meaning kept (English: "I sat and listened"). Everything else is either non-agreeing
(infinitives, "n'entend pas", "Chante.") or a generic plural ("les colons", "Ceux qui écoutent"), not a
single-pawn gendered form, so no switch is owed there. `translation_fr` stays `partial`: this session's own
reading is not the review TRANSLATIONS.md requires.

**Owed:** Virginie's own reading of the two files above, dated line here once done (`translation_fr` moves to
`complete` only then; a session cannot mark it).
